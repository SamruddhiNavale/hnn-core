There are several methods to do source reconstruction. Some of the methods
such as MNE are distributed source methods whereas dipole fitting will
estimate the location and amplitude of a single current dipole. At the
moment, we do not offer explicit recommendations on which source
reconstruction technique is best for HNN. However, we do want our users
to note that the dipole currents simulate with HNN are assumed to be normal
to the cortical surface. Hence, using the option ``pick_ori='normal'``
seems to make most sense.
