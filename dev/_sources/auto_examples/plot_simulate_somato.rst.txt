05. From MEG sensor-space data to HNN simulation
================================================

This example demonstrates how to calculate the inverse solution of the median
nerve evoked response in S1 from the MNE somatosensory dataset, and then
simulate a biophysical model network that reproduces the observed dynamics.

First, we will import the packages needed for computing the inverse solution
from the MNE somatosensory dataset. `MNE`_ can be installed with
``pip install mne``, and the somatosensory dataset can be downloaded by
importing ``somato`` from ``mne.datasets``.

Now we set the the path of the ``somato`` dataset for subject ``'01'``.

There are several methods to do source reconstruction. Some of the methods
such as MNE are distributed source methods whereas dipole fitting will
estimate the location and amplitude of a single current dipole. At the
moment, we do not offer explicit recommendations on which source
reconstruction technique is best for HNN. However, we do want our users
to note that the dipole currents simulated with HNN are assumed to be normal
to the cortical surface. Hence, using the option ``pick_ori='normal'`` is
appropriate.

Visualizing the distributed S1 activation in reference to the geometric
structure of the cortex (i.e., plotted on a structural MRI) can help us
figure out how to orient the dipole. Note that in the HNN framework,
positive and negative deflections of a current dipole source correspond to
upwards (from deep to superficial) and downwards (from superficial to deep)
current flow, respectively. Uncomment the following code to open an
interactive 3D render of the brain and its surface activation (requires the
``pyvista`` python library). You should get 2 plots, the first showing the
post-central gyrus label from which the dipole time course was extracted and
the second showing MNE activation at 0.040 sec that resemble the following
images.

Now we extract the representative time course of dipole activation in our
labeled brain region using ``mode='pca_flip'`` (see `this MNE-python
example`_ for more details). Note that the most prominent component of the
median nerve response occurs in the posterior wall of the central sulcus at
~0.040 sec. Since the dipolar activity here is negative, we orient the
extracted waveform so that the deflection at ~0.040 sec is pointed downwards.
Thus, the ~0.040 sec deflection corresponds to current flow traveling from
superficial to deep layers of cortex.

To simulate the source of the median nerve evoked response, we add a
sequence of synchronous evoked drives: 1 proximal, 2 distal, and 1 final
proximal drive. Note that setting ``sync_within_trial=True`` creates drives
with synchronous input (arriving to and transmitted by hypothetical granular
cells at the center of the network) to all pyramidal and basket cells that
receive distal drive. Note that granule cells are not explicitly modelled
within HNN.
